# ConsoleSnake

This is just a small project I made to try challenging myself. I developed it without using any explicit tutorials and thought through what was needed for it to work.

It is run entirely in the .NET console, and renders the game with a grid of ASCII characters. It has the basic features of snake, including randomly generated apples that increase the snakes length, self-collision ends the game and the snake wraps around the grid like pacman-warping.
